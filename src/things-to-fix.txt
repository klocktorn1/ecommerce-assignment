when pressing delete on a product all the way down, scrollbar jumps to top. annoying.

validation in create and update forms. Should try to not use alert and instead implement a <div>Validation message....</div> instead.


if a valid image url is not provided, product is still created. Either have validation for a valid image or let the 
product be created without an image. If created without image, have something that says "no image provided"






endpoints in the services files can be better

Only render customer table if there is a customer in the customer array. Now it renders an empty table (inside HandleCustomers page)

styling needs to be fixed overall

background is only as big as default screen height.
